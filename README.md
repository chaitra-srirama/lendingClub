LendingClub is an American peer-to-peer lending company that offers an online platform for matching borrowers seeking loans and lenders looking to make an investment. It provides an online platform which enables borrowers and investors to pair with each other. Both individuals and institutions can participate as investors if they satisfy financial stability standards put forth by LendingClub ("Lending Club" 5-6). 

LendingClub is appealing to investors because they can choose how much to fund each borrow at $25 increments ("Alternative Investments"). Investors who hold diverse portfolios with LendingClub historically have a positive return ("Your Return"). Investors have control over the amount of risk they choose to take on, and have access to risk grades from LendingClub. LendingClub grades all loans from A to G, with each grade being further divided into five subgrades based on factors such as the borrower's FICO score and loan amount ("LendingClub" 8-9). Because the notes have the status of unsecured creditors, there is a risk that investors may lose all or part of the money if LendingClub becomes insolvent, even if the ultimate borrower continues to payback money ("LendingClub" 12).

Interest rates vary 6.03% to 26.06% between different types of loans and depend on a large number of factors regarding the borrower ("LendingClub" 3). A background check performed by LendingClub takes into consideration the borrowerâ€™s credit score, credit history, income, and other attributes which help to determine the loan grade. The minimum credit criteria for borrowers to obtain a loan is:

* A minimum FICO score of 660
* Below 35% debt-to-income ratio excluding mortgages
* Good debt-to-income ratio including mortgages
* At least 36 months of credit history
* At least two open accounts
* No more than 6 recent (last 6 months) inquiries ("LendingClub" 6)

LendingClub makes money by charging fees to both the borrowers and the lenders. Borrowers pay an origination fee when the loan is given, and investors pay a service fee of 1% ("LendingClub" 10). LendingClub also charges investors collection fees when payments are missed by the borrower, if applicable ("Interest Rates and Fees").
